Build instructions for Maemo PhoneGap
=====================================

Assuming you have already installed Maemo SDK:
http://maemo.org/development/

Assuming Qt libraries for Maemo Scratchbox are installed.
* http://wiki.maemo.org/Qt4Hildon

Assuming you have checked out the project to your Scratchbox home dir:
/scratchbox/users/<you>/home/<you>/phonegap_maemo

Run following commands:
qmake
make

Start:
run-standalone.sh ./phonegap

The phonegap javascript libraries are packaged with an SCons script and 
the obfuscator requires Java. No need to run for demo unless changed,
So make sure they are installed if you change PhoneGap's javascripts.
You can run the packager outside Scratchbox at:
/scratchbox/users/<you>/home/<you>/phonegap_maemo

Run: 
scons && cp app.js www
