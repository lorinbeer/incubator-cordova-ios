</p>

<h3>1.0.0rc3 (20110726)</h3>
<ul>
<li>CHANGED: Update media implementation to match documentation. Significant modifications to match documentation. Using media.js from Android so significant changes to the code to match that architecture.  Created wrapper for AVAudioPlayer and Recorder to store the mediaId. Kept iOS only prepare() method but removed downloadCompleteCallback. Added seekTo method.</li>
<li>FIX: #188 Xcode 3 Template does not weak-link UIKit, AVFoundation and CoreMedia by default</li>

<li>FIX: #180 Add README.md to the installer package</li>
<li>FIX: #186 return null when no organization information. iOS was incorrectly returning an organization object with all null values when there was no organization information. It now correctly returns null.</li>
<li>FIX: #182 updated getCurrentPosition to update _position variable. Fixed bug where seekTo was setting the _position value in milliseconds rather than seconds. getCurrentPosition was not setting _position to -1 when media was not playing.</li>

<li>UPGRADERS: add the existing framework "CoreMedia" to your project, set it to weak/optional in your Target, copy the new phonegap.*.js files in manually to your www folder, and update your script references. Copy the .js files from /Users/Shared/PhoneGap/Frameworks/PhoneGap.framework/www. Copy the "Capture.bundle" from /Users/Shared/PhoneGap/Frameworks/PhoneGap.framework and add it to your project as well (or copy from a new project)</li>
<li>UPGRADERS: set the existing frameworks "UIKit" and "AVFoundation" to weak/optional (for iOS 3.x support)</li>
<li>CoreTelephony.framework can be removed in all projects, it is not needed anymore for the W3C Network Information API</li>
<li>Plugins MUST add their plugin mapping to PhoneGap.plist Plugins key, if not they will not work.</li>
<li>DEPRECATED: Camera.getPicture will be removed in 1.0 and put in the plugins repo, use the Media Capture API instead</li>
<li>DEPRECATED: Network.isReachable will be removed in 1.0, use the Network Information API instead</li>
<li>DEPRECATED: Notification activityStart, activityStop, loadingStart, loadingStop core plugin functions will be removed in 1.0 and put in the plugins repo</li>

<li>PhoneGapLib use is considered deprecated, for a future installer the Xcode 3 Template will use the PhoneGap.framework exclusively</li>
<li>Xcode 4 Template has an improved build script - it will detect whether the 'www' folder reference was added and will warn you if it has not been added (Xcode 4 UPGRADERS: you will need to grab the .js files manually from /Users/Shared/PhoneGap/Frameworks/PhoneGap.framework/www)</li>
</ul>

<h3>20110503</h3>

<li>the PhoneGap template is changed as well, at build time it will replace any references to 'src="phonegap.js"' to the new versioned js file (and copy the new phonegap.{ver}.min.js file). This replacement will look in all files in the 'www' folder.</li>
<li>note that with the new PhoneGapLib phonegap.{ver}.min.js renaming, existing PhoneGap templates must copy the new "Copy PhoneGap Javascript" post-build script from the new template (in Xcode, under Targets/[ProjectName])</li>

<li>To support orientation in your app: edit/add the UISupportedInterfaceOrientations (iPhone) or UISupportedInterfaceOrientations~ipad (iPad) key into your app's [appname]-Info.plist, with an array of strings that show what orientation your app supports. The supported values are: UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait, UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft, UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown, UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight. </li>
