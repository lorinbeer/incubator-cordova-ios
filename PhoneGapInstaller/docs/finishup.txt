Thanks for installing PhoneGap!

UPGRADERS
-------------------
1. Add the existing framework "CoreTelephony" to your project
2. Set it to weak/optional in your Target
3. Copy the new phonegap.*.js files in manually to your "www" folder (COPY from /Users/Shared/PhoneGap/Frameworks/PhoneGap.framework/www)
4. Update your script references in your HTML files to point to the .js files in (3).

XCODE 3
-------------
To get started creating PhoneGap projects, launch Xcode 3, then under the File menu, select "New Project...".

Navigate to the "User Templates" section, select PhoneGap, then in the right pane, select "PhoneGap-based Application"

Select the "Choose..." button, name your project and choose the location where you want the new project to be.

That's it! Modify the contents of the "www" directory to add your HTML, CSS and Javascript.

XCODE 4
-------------

To get started creating PhoneGap projects, launch Xcode 4, then under the File menu, select "New Project...".

Navigate to the "iOS" section, select Application, then in the right pane, select "PhoneGap-based Application"

Select the "Next" button, name your project and bundle identifier, then select the "Next" button and choose the location where you want the new project to be.

*IMPORTANT*: On first run, it will create a sample "www" folder for you inside your project. After that, you MUST drag and drop the "www" folder into your project in Xcode, to create a folder reference for it. 

*IMPORTANT*: For the "CoreTelephony" framework, you MUST set the linkage as "optional", if not iOS 3.x devices will crash. The linkage type could not be set in the template itself (undocumented).

That's it! Modify the contents of the "www" directory to add your HTML, CSS and Javascript.
