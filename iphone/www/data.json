After graduating with a major in physics and a minor in English at the University of California at Berkeley in 1990, I spent a year writing software in Amsterdam before returning to San Francisco to join the nascent Internet boom. I did a stint working for Microsoft's Bay Area office, then I lept into the Web with both feet, working on dozens of Web sites and Web software packages between 1995 and 2001. I developed a passion for Open Source software and Open Content, grass-roots Internet culture, and SF's Burning Man-oriented techno-artistico-music scene. I was lucky enough to meet my wife Maj during this time.\r\n\r\nIn 2001 I got a generous layoff package from RSA Security and took the opportunity to quit the expensive hurly-burly SF lifestyle. I piled my belongings into the back of my beloved 1972 Citroen DS and spent the next 6 months alone driving around Canada, the United States, and Mexico. I eventually settled in Montreal to write my first novel (still unfinished), then joined Maj in Geneva for a round-the-world trip including touring Southeast Asia and living in Lisbon for a season. We returned to Montreal in July 2003 for Maj to start graduate school at McGill University, and as a side-project started Wikitravel.\r\n\r\nA year later, we were married on the platform of the Biodome in Montreal. Today, we're still living in Montreal, parents of a beautiful 8-month-old girl named Amita June.

The <a href=\"http:\/\/beta.greenbuildingbrain.org\/\" id=\"ao_4\" title=\"Green Building Brain\">Green Building Brain<\/a> is a database of green building and planning resources. By facilitating the sharing of information the project is designed to accelerate and increase the industry's impact on increasing building sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe open-source model of development has had a substantial impact on the field of sustainable, or green building.  Traditional design and construction has operated on a hierarchical model of decision making and protection of intellectual property, whereas green building design incorporates the shared development model of open-source, involving all designers, as well as the users and operators throughout the design and construction of a project.\r\n\r\nThere have been innovations in the field of green building that could also benefit the open-source development community. The Integrated Design Process (IDP) involves all of the project stakeholders in a series of design workshops or \"charrettes\", and has been practiced on scales from half a dozen participants to \"BIMStorms\", live on-line design charrettes involving whole cities and hundreds of participants. This process can be applied not only to buildings, but to any design problem, including software development. We will discuss how this process can be applied and how it was implemented on the \"Green Building Brain\" project.\r\n\r\nCombining online collaborative tools, with frequent intensive live interactions is also affecting the creation of a sustainable community. Drawing an existing community online is a challenging process, and many well-designed projects have failed due to not paying enough attention to this crucial step. We will discuss the challenges and lessons learned in taking a project from a small group of initiators, to a local community of stakeholders, and finally transitioning to an international user base.","track":"A","room":"201"},{"datetime":"2009-06-11 10:30","speaker":{"name":"John Boxall","twitter":"johnboxall","thumb":"http:\/\/openwebvancouver.ca\/sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/mobile_thumb\/john_boxall.jpg","site":"http:\/\/johnboxall.ca","bio":"Genius billionaire playboy web developer."},"title":"Squinty Eyes","description":"Year over year reports of finger cramps are up five hundred percent in what doctors can only describe as \"really scary\".

One of the next battles in keeping the web open is keeping data open - from the content we \"generate\" for many social sites to the closed silos of government and businesses.\r\n\r\nJust like open source, open data is a mix of technology, licensing, and attitude. Here in Vancouver, we've started experimenting with what I like to call a Semantic Web Community \"Barn Raising\" effort. Lots of people are interested in open data and related technology that supports it, like the semantic web, RDF, etc. But it's very hard to just have nice thought experiments about all this, we learn best by doing.\r\n\r\nRecently, I gave a talk at DrupalCon Washington DC talking about the semantic web. I said that RDFa is \"food for robots\", so what better data to experiment with than something related to food?\r\n\r\nThe project we're tackling is to collectively source restaurant information. The information will be stored in part on <a href=\"http:\/\/freebase.com\">Freebase<\/a>, as well as various front end mashups, iPhone apps, and other tools. Eventually, we hope to create an economic incentive so that some restaurants and\/or restaurant directory websites will expose their data semantically.\r\n\r\nThe talk will be a mix of community, policy, hand waving, and technology, as well as an open call to help with this project in your own city. You'll leave with some food for thought on how open data and the semantic web are evolving, and what you can do with it today.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nFor more information, see the following links:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/wiki.openrestaurants.org\">Open Restaurants Wiki<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.baconpatiobeer.com\">BaconPatioBeer Blog<\/a><\/li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/vancouver.freebase.com\">Vancouver base on Freebase<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>","track":"A","room":"201"},{"datetime":"2009-06-11 10:30","speaker":{"name":"Irwin Oostindie","twitter":"Dutchphoto","thumb":"http:\/\/openwebvancouver.ca\/sites\/default\/files\/imagecache\/mobile_thumb\/irwin_oostindie.jpg","site":"http:\/\/www.creativetechnology.org","bio":"Irwin is a Dutch\/Canadian artist and administrator doing cultural planning, cultural infrastructure development, and support for a media arts cluster in Vancouver's inner-city. www.creativetechnology.org is a 14,395 square foot media arts centre being developed parallel to a massive inner-city redevelopment www.woodwardsdistrict.com that opens before the 2010 Winter Olympics.
